## I did...

- [ ] not like the Labs at all! >:(
- [ ] really enjoy it! :-)

## Why?

- [ ] Too complicated / Learning curve too step
- [ ] Too easy
- [ ] Didn't make any sense
- [ ] Too much / not enough documentation
- [ ] The CI/CD pipeline thing didn't make sense

- [ ] It was challenging in a good way
- [ ] Documentation helped
- [ ] CI/CD was awesome!

## More feedback / What do you think could be improved?
