# Getting ready to run the AS3 Ninja Labs

Checkout [how to run the Labs locally](run_locally.md) or [using GitHub with Fork, modify and create a pull request to use the linked CI/CD](GetReady/use_github+cicd.md).

If you already know your way dive right in and [start with Lab1](../Lab1/).

Have fun! :-)
